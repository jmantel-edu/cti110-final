## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox or other browser to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- HTML
- The various tools that I used (see Resources)

### What I learned

I figured out that some properties only applied properly when applied to all children rather than the parent.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to get to understand the CSS Grid more and use it to create websites easier than before. I would also like to learn techniques to measure the proportions of the example images to make a site closer to the vision given (The proportions as they are in the final project don't match exactly.)

### Useful resources
- [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgridgenerator.io/) - Made creating the grid layout really easy.
- [CSS box-shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - Helped me adjust the box shadow.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - An amazing resource which I used a lot of times; there's no one best article I can site.
- [HTML Beautifier](https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer#) I used it to fix my messy code in preparation for a large update.
